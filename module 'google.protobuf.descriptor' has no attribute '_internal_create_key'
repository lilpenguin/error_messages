Details on how this error occurred:
I built TASO(https://github.com/jiazhihao/TASO) from source using a protobuf library installed locally, but the version of the protobuf that I installed was different from the one used by python.

Solution that worked for me:
Update the protobuf version used by python to match the one that I installed, which was protobuf 3.14.0.
$ pip install --upgrade protobuf
Successfully installed protobuf-3.14.0
