CUDNN failure: CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED

Aborting...

How this error happened:
I installed TASO(https://github.com/jiazhihao/TASO) from source with CUDA 11.0 and a matching cudnn 8.0.4.30-11.0. But nvidia-smi gave me:
Driver Version: 440.64.00
The driver version was too low to support CUDA 11.0. Check compatibile driver versions with different cuda versions here:
https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html

Solution that worked for me:
I changed the cuda version to 10.1 and the cudnn version to a matching one (7.6.5.32-10.1), and the problem was solved.
