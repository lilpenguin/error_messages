CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.18/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:165 (message):
  Could NOT find Threads (missing: Threads_FOUND)
Call Stack (most recent call first):

  CMakeLists.txt:112 (find_package)

How the problem occurred:
I pulled a docker image using Singularity, started a shell in the container and tried to build a software in shell. But cmake cannot find pthreads. This happened to two different docker images.

Solution that worked for me:
I used the remote builder (https://cloud.sylabs.io/home) instead. The software was built successfully.
